Painting app made with go, using [gtk4 bindings](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4).

## Current status

At the moment of writing, this is really in an initial state. I'm still learning GTK and all that it encompasses. But the goal is to have a basic painting app.

## MVP

The MVP will require:

- Tools
  - Eraser
  - Pen/Pencil
  - Bucket
- Basic Swatch Color Picker
- Good mouse tracking (in the very first trial, there's some spacing between painting)
